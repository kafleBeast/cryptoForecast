This is a dashboard built in python using the dash framework. 
This user-friendly dashboard is built primarily to forecast crypto price and volatility, but can be used for any other asset class.
The dashboard allows users to select the type of model, specify the dataset range for training, determine the number of
training cycles, adjust the number of layers for deep learning methods, and set the sliding window size
for data processing. 

Files:
requirements.txt contains all the packages required for this project.
app.py contains all the code for the dashboard. It is a single page web application.

The dashboard was built as a part of a master's thesis titled "COMPARATIVE STUDY OF CRYPTO VOLATILITY AND PRICE FORECASTING
USING A MIXTURE OF TIME SERIES AND MACHINE LEARNING MODELS".
